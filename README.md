# Watched
This is a personal project, the aim is to put into practice some architecture ideas that I learned over time and while studying.

The project is only the Android app for now.
Is an app to keep track of your watched movies and series, you can rate and comment on your 'Watched's.
In a near future, it will allow you to connect with a social media account, find friends and see what friends think about a specific 'Watched'.

The Data is provided by [The Movies Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).
