# Watched ðŸŽ¬
This is a personal project. The objective is to put together some architecture ideas that I learned over time and while studying.

The project is only the Android app for now.

The app helps you to keep track of all of your watched movies and series. You'll be able to rate and comment on your 'Watched's.
In the future, it will allow you to connect with a social media account, find friends and see what friends think about a specific 'Watched'.

The Data is provided by [The Movies Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).
